## Interactive Plot

Chicks were weighed every second day for 21 days. As the time period increases, the marker grows larger.

```{r plotly}
data("ChickWeight")
fig <- plot_ly(ChickWeight, x = ~Chick, y = ~weight, type = "scatter", mode = "markers", color = ~factor(Diet), size = ~Time)
fig <- fig %>% layout(
    xaxis = list(title = "Chick ID"),
    yaxis = list(title = "Weight (grams)")
    )
fig <- fig %>% layout(legend=list(title=list(text='<b> Diets </b>')))
fig
```
